User API with Express.js
This project is a simple Express.js application that provides a RESTful API for managing a list of users. The data is served from a mock JSON file, MOCK_DATA.json, allowing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The server handles both HTML and JSON responses for users, enabling easy interaction through the browser or API clients.

Key Features:
GET /: Displays a welcome message.
GET /users: Displays a list of user first names in HTML format.
GET /api/users: Returns all users as a JSON response.
GET /api/users/:id: Returns a specific user by ID in JSON format.
POST /api/users: Adds a new user to the list.
PATCH /api/users/:id: Updates a user's information by ID.
DELETE /api/users/:id: Deletes a user by ID.
DELETE /api/users: Removes the last user from the list.
Technology Stack:
Node.js and Express.js for the backend server.
fs module for file system operations to read and write to MOCK_DATA.json.
